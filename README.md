# MTB-Spring-Calc

https://davidharuch.github.io/MTB-Spring-Calc/LRspring.html

I was tired of hearing "what coil weight should I get", and existing spring calcs aren't too good. Manufacturer ones don't let you put in custom parts either :-(. So I made my own in javascript with a website gui.

The more people that use it and give feedback to me the better it will get because I can update my models! If you use it please send me a screenshot of your inputs, your bike brand/model and size, and any measurements you've made like % sag, sprung/unsprung weights, etc...

It is already much more advanced than most free calculators as for as I know

## Novel Features

* Bike sprung/unsprung mass estimation
* Damper gas Force included
* Non-constant leverage ratio curves
* Outputs of sag, natural frequency, bottom out force, bottom out energy instead of just sag

## Planned features

* Nonlinear leverage ratio input
* Graphical plotting of force/displacement, spring rate/displacement, etc...
* Air shock comparission for reference from dyno/spring data
